Tic Tac Toe
Define an object ticTacToe.

Follow the test specs to create a board property, move method, and a clear method.

The board property is a grid of arrays that represents the board, where each cell is initially null.

The move method is a method that, given a character, a row number, and a column number, adds the character to the correct cell in the board.

The clear method should reset the board to all nulls.
